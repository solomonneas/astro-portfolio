# This Week I Shipped More Than Most Teams Do in a Quarter

I'm a lab assistant at a community college making $17/hour. I drive 4 hours a day. I'm finishing my third degree in five years. And this week, working solo, I shipped a production threat intel tool, built a 14-page operational command center, automated a cross-platform social media pipeline, overhauled my LinkedIn with real cost-avoidance numbers ($300K+/year), hardened my infrastructure after catching an unauthorized login from India, and killed 8 projects that weren't pulling their weight.

Here's the short version of what happened and why it matters.

## CyberBRIEF is Live

My threat intelligence research tool went from localhost to production this week. It's at [cyberbrief.solomonneas.dev](https://cyberbrief.solomonneas.dev), powered by Perplexity Pro, and it does what most enterprise threat intel platforms charge five figures for: structured research with ATT&CK mapping, IOC extraction, and tiered analysis depth.

It's rate-limited (I'm paying for those API calls), but it works. Try it.

## The Dev Dashboard Died. The Ops Deck Lives.

What started as a project link page became a full operational hub. 14 pages covering everything from cron job visualization to GPU monitoring to social media scheduling with direct Postiz API integration. Built Phase 1 in six minutes with a sub-agent. The rest took two days of focused work.

## I Automated My Content Pipeline

Draft a post, approve it in the Ops Deck, n8n picks it up, Postiz publishes to LinkedIn, Bluesky, and Mastodon. Character limits validated server-side because Postiz silently drops posts that are too long (learned that one the hard way).

Rewrote all 54 queued posts in my actual voice this week. Not the "thought leader" voice. The real one.

## And I Caught an Intruder

Someone logged into my Telegram from India. Killed the session, enabled 2FA, audited the entire infrastructure. WSL was clean. Hardened the Windows host: RDP and SSH locked to LAN, SMB disabled, 14 dead port proxies cleaned up.

The contrast between my title and my output is the whole story. I'm not waiting for someone to give me a senior role. I'm building the resume that makes the title irrelevant.
