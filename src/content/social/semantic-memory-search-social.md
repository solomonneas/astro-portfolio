# Semantic Memory Search & Code Indexing Social Media Drafts

## LinkedIn (Personal)

Most AI agents forget everything between sessions. Mine doesn't.

I run a personal AI agent (powered by OpenClaw) that manages my entire development workflow. I built a semantic memory and code indexing system for it that runs entirely on local hardware. No API calls, no cloud dependencies, no per-token costs. Here's how it works.

The memory layer uses nomic-embed-text (a 137M parameter embedding model) running on an NVIDIA RTX Ada 2000 to vectorize everything my personal AI agent writes: daily logs, decisions, project context, lessons learned. When a new session starts, my agent searches its own memory semantically instead of loading everything into context. It pulls exactly what's relevant and nothing else.

The code search layer is more interesting. I wrote a custom indexer that splits source code at function, class, and export boundaries using language-aware regex patterns (Python, TypeScript, and generic fallbacks). Each chunk gets two things: a raw code embedding and a natural language summary generated by Qwen 2.5 14B (a 14 billion parameter model running locally via Ollama). Both the code and the summary get embedded separately by nomic-embed-text.

Search is weighted: 35% code similarity, 65% summary similarity. That means you can search in plain English ("where do we handle webhook retries") and get back the exact function, even if those words never appear in the code. Three search modes: hybrid (default), code-only, and summary-only.

The indexer runs nightly via cron. It uses MD5 content hashing per chunk so only changed files get re-processed. A full re-index across 40+ projects takes about 30 minutes. Incremental runs finish in seconds.

The practical result: my personal AI agent can search 40+ repositories, 400K+ lines of code, and months of operational memory without burning a single cloud API token. The expensive models (Claude Opus, GPT Codex) only touch work that requires judgment. Everything else runs on local silicon.

Your AI agent doesn't need to call OpenAI's embedding API every time it searches your codebase.

We built a semantic code search and memory system for our personal AI agent (powered by OpenClaw) that runs entirely on local GPU hardware. Zero cloud API costs for indexing, embedding, and retrieval.

The stack: nomic-embed-text (137M parameters) handles all embeddings. Qwen 2.5 14B generates natural language summaries of every code chunk. Both models run locally on an NVIDIA RTX Ada 2000 via Ollama. The indexer splits code at function and class boundaries, not arbitrary line counts, so search results return complete, meaningful units.

The result: plain-English search across 40+ repositories and months of operational context. "Where do we validate API keys" returns the exact middleware function, even if those words never appear in the source.

This is the kind of infrastructure we set up for clients through our OpenClaw configuration service. Your hardware, your data, your search index.
