# I Built an AI-Powered Threat Intelligence Reporter

Threat intelligence has a formatting problem. Analysts spend more time writing reports than doing actual analysis. By the time the BLUF summary reaches leadership, the threat landscape has already moved.

So I built CyberBRIEF: a platform that takes a topic, URLs, raw text, or PDFs and produces a complete intelligence report. MITRE ATT&CK mappings. IOC extraction. Academic citations. TLP classification. Executive-ready BLUF summaries. All synthesized through tiered AI research (free, standard, or deep) depending on how much depth you need.

The free tier uses Brave Search and Gemini Flash. The deep tier runs Perplexity Deep Research with full context history. Every tier produces the same structured output. The difference is depth, not quality.

It is open source, self-hosted, and designed for teams that cannot afford six-figure threat intel subscriptions but still need professional-grade reporting.

If you work in threat intelligence or teach cybersecurity, I would love to hear what your reporting workflow looks like today.
