    <h2>// Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Building a performant, content-driven portfolio website using the Astro framework. This site serves as both a
        professional portfolio and a learning playground for modern web development.
    </p>

    <h2>// Technical Implementation</h2>
    <p>The site is built with a focus on performance and developer experience:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Astro's static site generation for fast page loads</li>
        <li>Content collections for blog posts and project pages</li>
        <li>Custom terminal-inspired design system</li>
        <li>Dynamic theme switching with CSS variables</li>
        <li>Continuous deployment via Vercel and GitHub</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>// Design Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        The "Industrial Terminal / NOC Dashboard" aesthetic balances professional presentation with technical
        credibility. The design appeals to both recruiters and fellow developers.
    </p>

    <h2>// Status</h2>
    <p>Core site complete. Continuously adding content and refining the design based on feedback.</p>
</ProjectLayout>
