<ProjectLayout frontmatter={frontmatter}>
    <h2>// Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Building a "second brain" using interconnected markdown notes and zettelkasten methodology. This knowledge
        management system helps organize learning, capture ideas, and connect concepts across domains.
    </p>

    <h2>// Technical Implementation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Obsidian vault with custom folder structure</li>
        <li>Zettelkasten-style atomic notes with linking</li>
        <li>Daily notes for journaling and task tracking</li>
        <li>Git-based backup and version control</li>
        <li>Templates for different note types</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>// Benefits</h2>
    <p>
        The interconnected nature of the vault surfaces connections between ideas that wouldn't be apparent in
        traditional note-taking systems.
    </p>

    <h2>// Status</h2>
    <p>Active daily use. Continuously refining workflow and adding content.</p>
</ProjectLayout>
