  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Learning the Go programming language for building efficient CLI tools and system utilities. Go's simplicity and
    strong standard library make it ideal for infrastructure automation.
  </p>

  <h2>Learning Path</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Go syntax and idioms</li>
    <li>Concurrency with goroutines and channels</li>
    <li>Building command-line applications</li>
    <li>Working with files and network operations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Go</h2>
  <p>
    Go compiles to a single binary with no dependencies, making it perfect for deploying tools to servers without
    runtime requirements. The language's focus on simplicity aligns well with infrastructure work.
  </p>

  <h2>Status</h2>
  <p>Working through fundamentals. Building small utility projects for practice.</p>
