    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Building a redundant homelab cluster for DevOps experimentation, security testing, and self-hosted services. The
        lab serves as a sandbox for learning and prototyping.
    </p>

    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
    <p>Multi-node Proxmox cluster with enterprise features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Three-node Proxmox VE cluster with HA</li>
        <li>Ceph distributed storage for VM replication</li>
        <li>VLAN segmentation for network isolation</li>
        <li>ZFS for local backup storage</li>
        <li>Automated backups to off-site storage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Services Hosted</h2>
    <p>
        Running various self-hosted services including Pi-hole, Gitea, monitoring stack, and development environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Status</h2>
    <p>Core infrastructure operational. Continuously adding services and optimizing configurations.</p>
