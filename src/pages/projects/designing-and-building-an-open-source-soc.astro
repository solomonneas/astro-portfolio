<ProjectLayout frontmatter={frontmatter}>
  <h2>// Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Building a full-stack Security Operations Center using entirely open-source tools. This project provides hands-on
    experience with enterprise security monitoring while creating a functional threat detection and response platform
    for the college network.
  </p>

  <h2>// Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>The SOC architecture integrates multiple open-source security tools:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Wazuh:</strong> Host-based intrusion detection and log analysis</li>
    <li><strong>Zeek & Suricata:</strong> Network traffic analysis and IDS/IPS</li>
    <li><strong>TheHive & Cortex:</strong> Incident response and automated analysis</li>
    <li><strong>MISP:</strong> Threat intelligence sharing platform</li>
    <li><strong>Elasticsearch:</strong> Centralized log storage and search</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>// Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    All components are containerized using Docker and deployed on Proxmox VE for easy management and scalability. The
    system ingests logs from Windows and Linux endpoints, network devices, and cloud services.
  </p>

  <h2>// Status</h2>
  <p>Core infrastructure deployed. Currently integrating threat intelligence feeds and building detection rules.</p>
