    <h2>// Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Researching security vulnerabilities in national critical infrastructure, specifically water and wastewater
        treatment facilities. This project examined the unique challenges of securing operational technology
        environments.
    </p>

    <h2>// Research Focus</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Analysis of recent cyberattacks on water utilities</li>
        <li>Common vulnerabilities in SCADA and ICS systems</li>
        <li>Regulatory frameworks (AWIA, NIST CSF)</li>
        <li>Best practices for small utility security programs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>// Key Findings</h2>
    <p>
        Many small utilities lack dedicated security staff and rely on outdated systems. The research proposed
        practical, low-cost security improvements for resource-constrained organizations.
    </p>

    <h2>// Status</h2>
    <p>Research paper completed and submitted.</p>
