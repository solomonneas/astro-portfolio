    <h2>// Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Leading a critical infrastructure migration project to transition the college's virtualization platform from
        Microsoft Hyper-V to Proxmox VE. This initiative aims to reduce licensing costs while improving flexibility and
        performance for academic lab environments.
    </p>

    <h2>// Technical Implementation</h2>
    <p>The migration involves careful planning and execution across multiple phases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inventory and assessment of existing Hyper-V virtual machines and configurations</li>
        <li>Setting up Proxmox VE cluster with high availability</li>
        <li>Converting VHDX disk images to QCOW2 format</li>
        <li>Migrating network configurations and VLAN assignments</li>
        <li>Testing and validation in parallel environment before cutover</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>// Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        Key challenges include maintaining uptime during migration, ensuring compatibility with existing Active
        Directory integration, and retraining staff on the new platform.
    </p>

    <h2>// Status</h2>
    <p>Currently in the planning and assessment phase. Target completion: Q2 2026.</p>
