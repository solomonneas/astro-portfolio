<ProjectLayout frontmatter={frontmatter}>
  <h2>// Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Mastering modal editing and building a custom Lua-based Neovim configuration. The goal is to create an efficient,
    keyboard-driven development environment that enhances productivity across all programming languages.
  </p>

  <h2>// Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>Started with LazyVim as a base configuration and progressively customizing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Learning Vim motions and modal editing paradigms</li>
    <li>Configuring LSP servers for multiple languages</li>
    <li>Setting up Treesitter for syntax highlighting</li>
    <li>Building custom keymaps for workflow optimization</li>
    <li>Integrating with terminal multiplexers (tmux)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>// Why Neovim</h2>
  <p>
    The ability to work entirely from the terminal, combined with the extensibility of Lua plugins, makes Neovim ideal
    for remote server administration and development in constrained environments.
  </p>

  <h2>// Status</h2>
  <p>Comfortable with basic motions. Currently learning advanced text objects and building muscle memory.</p>
