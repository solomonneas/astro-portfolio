# AI Invaders - Social Media Drafts

## LinkedIn

I built a Space Invaders clone from scratch. No frameworks, no dependencies, just a single HTML file with vanilla JavaScript and the Canvas API.

The enemies? Logos from various AI companies. The boss? A three-phase fight with escalating attack patterns.

Why put a game in a cybersecurity portfolio?

Because building a real-time game engine from scratch demonstrates the same fundamentals that matter in security work:

- Event-driven architecture (like SIEM event processing)
- Delta-time calculations for frame-independent physics (timing-sensitive operations)
- State management without frameworks (working in constrained environments)
- The Canvas API and Web Audio API for zero-dependency deployment

Technical highlights:
- requestAnimationFrame game loop with deltaTime-based movement
- Programmatic sound effects via AudioContext (no audio files)
- Touch controls for mobile play
- Three-phase boss fight with distinct attack patterns

Sometimes the best way to show you understand systems is to build something fun.

Built a Space Invaders clone in a single HTML file. Zero dependencies.

Enemies are AI company logos. Boss fight has 3 phases with escalating attacks.

All sound effects synthesized via AudioContext. Touch controls for mobile. deltaTime for consistent physics.

Why a game in a security portfolio? Because fundamentals matter.

## Mastodon

I made a Space Invaders game in one HTML file. No build tools, no npm, no frameworks.

The enemies are logos from various AI companies, and there is a three-phase boss fight that gets progressively harder.

Some fun technical bits:
- Canvas API with requestAnimationFrame
- deltaTime so physics work the same on 60Hz and 144Hz displays
- Sound effects generated in real time via Web Audio API oscillators
- Touch controls so it works on mobile too

It lives in my portfolio alongside security tools and dashboards. Variety is good.

Built a Space Invaders clone from scratch in vanilla JS. Single HTML file, zero dependencies.

AI company logos as enemies. Three-phase boss fight. Sound effects synthesized via Web Audio API. Touch controls for mobile.

The game loop pattern (requestAnimationFrame + deltaTime) is the same event-driven architecture used in real-time monitoring systems. Fundamentals transfer everywhere.

**New post: Building AI Invaders**

I built a Space Invaders clone from scratch using vanilla JavaScript and the Canvas API. One file, no dependencies, no build step.

In the post, I break down the game loop architecture, how deltaTime keeps physics consistent across different refresh rates, why I synthesized all sound effects in code instead of using audio files, and how a three-phase boss fight teaches you about escalating complexity curves.

I also make the case for why a game belongs in a cybersecurity portfolio. (Spoiler: the fundamentals are the same ones that matter for real-time monitoring and event-driven systems.)
